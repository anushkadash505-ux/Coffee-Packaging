# Project Title: ARBOR VITAE COFFEE: An AI-Generated Visual Identity

This project focuses on the rapid conceptualization of a premium brand identity for Arbor Vitae Coffee. Drawing on the elegant Latin name 'Tree of Life,' the visual exploration aimed for a blend of classic sophistication and organic simplicity. The design utilizes a minimalist, stylized logo of a seed/sprout within a circular emblem, paired with an earthy, muted color palette (creams, subtle greens, terracotta accents) to convey natural purity and premium quality on packaging mockups.

## How to Reproduce / Use

Achieving this clean, natural yet refined aesthetic required careful prompt engineering. The following configuration consistently delivered the best aesthetic results for the brand's desired look:

**Core Prompt**: Minimalist logo concept for Arbor Vitae Coffee which gives the premium feeling, featuring a single line art element of a coffee bean and a leaf, earthy color palette (dark green, terracotta, cream), on a sustainable kraft paper coffee pouch mockup, high quality, vector graphic appearance, branding design.

**Model**: Shakker Zeno 1

## To add additional mockups

**Core Prompt 1**: Keep the same logo on first image and use it on the second image.

**Core Prompt 2**: Keep the same logo and use it on this image and remove the half circle from the logo.
